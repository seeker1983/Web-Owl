In Default\Preferences.sublime-setting I have

    "folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS"],

I want to write in User\Preferences.sublime-setting or project-name.sublime-settings something like

"folder_exclude_patterns" += [".idea", ".sbt"]

Which makes much more sense when copying and extending original array.

Is it possible in some way?
